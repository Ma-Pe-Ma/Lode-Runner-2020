# Lode Runner 2020 - Android Port

This is folder contains the source for the Android port of [Lode Runner 2020](https://github.com/Ma-Pe-Ma/Lode-Runner-2020).<br>

## Building

1. Clone the repository recursively (to clone the submodules too):

        git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ma-Pe-Ma/Lode-Runner-2020.git

2. At the [Android/common](./common) folder you can find a *vorbis_working_cmakelists* directory. Copy and paste the content to the vorbis folder (confirm overwriting).<br>
(These files are needed to build the libvorbis and libvorbisfile libraries properly into the app.)

3. From the [assets folder](../Assets), copy the Level, SFX, Texture (but NOT the Shaders!) folders to /Android/LodeRunnerAndroid/src/main/assets directory.

4. Copy the [src/loderunner](../src/loderunner/) folder to /Android/LodeRunnerAndroid/src/main/cpp/

5. Open the Android folder/project with Android Studio. NDK needs to be installed to build the project.<br>Now you should be able to build the project successfully.

At the release section you can find the Android version's APK installer too.

You have to enable installing 3rd party softwares in the system settings or a notification will show up.

## Known bugs

1. Activity handling and switching between apps is messed up, not always working correctly
2. Texture mapping is misplaced somehow (probably the shaders have precision problems).
3. Blending is messed up too

## Future plans

1. Implement controlling by motion sensors.
2. Fix mentioned bugs.

**Have fun playing with it!**
